    "description": "A trading strategy shared by [kjmsb2](https://www.reddit.com/user/kjmsb2) on [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/b1tuhb/a_lazy_way_to_trade_forex/).\n\n------------\n\nI have been using this method for a while with pretty consistent results.\n\nI use 3 pairs on the daily charts (chart time frame is actually irrelevant): EURJPY, EURUSD, USDJPY. This gives me a hedge between the 3 positions.\n\nAt the opening hour of Forex trading (5pm EST Sunday for me) I place both a pending buy-stop and sell-stop order 30 pips away from the opening price for each pair.\n\nI place stop-loss at 50 pips and take-profit at 150 pips for each. I also instruct MT4 to use a trailing stop of 500 points (50 pips) once the position moves in to profit.\n\nThat's it.\n\nI now wait for 1 to 3 orders to fill and either hit target or stop. If it hits stop I will re-enter a new pending order the same as the one just stopped.\n\nIf my targets are hit... GREAT! If not, at Friday 3pm EST I close all open positions and cancel any open pending orders.\n\nPosition size for me is 1% of account size on a 50 pip stop loss for each position.\n\nConsistent results with literally only a few MINUTES per week of management.",
